Pierre should be able to click a Vendor's name and go to a new page that will display all of that Vendor's orders.
Pierre should be provided with a link to a page presenting him with a form to create a new Order for a particular Vendor. Hint: The route for this page might look something like: "/vendors/1/orders/new".
